# Pronouns in Politics

A data research project for USC GESM-161 with Professor Dennis Wixon.

## Research question

How do Barack Obama and Donald Trump use personal pronouns in political speeches?

### Sub-questions

1. What are the frequencies of first-person singular (I/me/my) versus first-person plural
(we/us/our) pronouns for each person?
2. Is there a significant difference in ratio of pronoun usage between each person?
3. How does the context and purpose of the speech affect pronoun usage?
4. Does choice of personal pronoun change over time?
5. When plural pronouns are used, what groups do they refer to?

## Rationale

I am interested in this topic because politicians typically use and choose words carefully according to the political or ideological message they aim to convey; or, at the least, the words they use can reveal information about them. For example, pronouns reveal information about the politician’s relationships and attitudes. Words such as we/us/our are in-group words, which draw the audience in, while words such as I/me/my are out-group words, which push the audience away (Hasan 5). Therefore, pronoun choice can be used to investigate both the politician’s self-image and their relationships with their colleagues, the audience, and the nation.
