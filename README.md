# Pronouns in Politics

A data research project for USC GESM-161 with Professor Dennis Wixon.

## Introduction

The goal of this study was to investigate the difference in pronoun usage between Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump using linguistic data from examples of specific political speech types.

## Background

Political rhetoric, or persuasive language, is typically crafted carefully according to the political or ideological message politicians aim to convey. One seemingly trivial but functionally significant element of language and word choice is that of pronouns. Pronouns—words that refer to previously mentioned people, objects or concepts—can reveal information about a politician’s relationship with the audience, attitudes towards certain topics, and affiliations with certain groups. Firstly, in regard to demonstrating relationships, pronouns such as we/us/our are in-group words, which draw the audience in, while pronouns such as I/me/my are out-group words, which push the audience away (Hasan 5). Secondly, in regard to attitudes and affiliations, words immediately following pronouns can indicate frequent topics or concerns of the speaker. Therefore, pronoun usage can be used to build a linguistic profile of a politician, which reveal information about the politician’s relationships, attitudes, and affiliations.

## Method

1. Transcripts extracted for six speech types: president-elect victory speech, inaugural presidential address, United Nations General Assembly speech, State of the Union address, response to a tragedy event, and speech to a foreign nation.
2. Word lists generated.
3. Cluster lists generated.
4. In-group and out-group pronouns tabulated.
5. ANOVA test conducted.
6. Clustered stacked bar charts and slopegraphs created.
